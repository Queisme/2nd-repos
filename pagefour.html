        <h3>This page is all about <strong>Lists</strong>.</h3>
            <p>I know. <em>So</em> exciting.</p>

            <p>The lists will be as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An unordered shopping list of my favorite foods.</li>
                    <li>An ordered list of todo's to do today.</li>
                    <li>An unordered list of places I'd like to visit.</li>
                    <li>An ordered list of my top 5 video games.</li>
                </ol>
            
            <p>The emotions that are welling up in me are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm tired.</li>
                    <li>My butt's numb.</li>
                    <li>I want something to eat but have no idea what.</li>
                    <li>My brain has turned into mush because I can't decide between butts and butt's.</li>
                </ul>

        <h4>An unordered shopping list of my favorite foods:</h4>
