    <p>This page is going to be about links and images. You ready for it?</p>
    <img src="../img/buckle.png" alt="A sign reminding people to buckle up as it could save your life."><br>

    <a href="../img/doeet.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click me! Do eet!</a>

    <p>A <em>rel</em> attribute is use to describe the relationship between the current page and the linked.</p>
    
    <p>The <strong>noopener</strong> value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which is was opened. Basically, it's a security measure.</p>

    <p>The <strong>noreferrer</strong> value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage has a reference to it.</p>

    <p>Newer versions of browsers provide this security. To err on the side of caution, always pair a <em>target="_blank"</em> with a <em>rel="noopener noreferrer"</em>.</p>
