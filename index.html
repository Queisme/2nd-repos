        <p><strong>A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationship between its parts</strong>. <a href="http://www.google.com">Markup</a> is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.</p>

        <p><em>A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs</em>. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts</p>
